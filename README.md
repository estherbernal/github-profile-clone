## Description

A clone of the user's repositories profile page from GitHub, using React and GitHub GraphQL API (v4).

## Before starting

You will need the GitHub API base endpoint as an environment variable:

    REACT_APP_GITHUB_BASE=https://api.github.com/graphql

For your convenience when reviewing the test, I have already uploaded the .env file

It is needed a GitHub API token. To get yours, you can follow the steps indicated [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.19/user/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

### How to run the project

    npm i
    npm start
